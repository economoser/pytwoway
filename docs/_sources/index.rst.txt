pytwoway
========

pytwoway is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation
of two way fixed effect models for labor. It includes AKM, homoskedastic- and heteroskedastic-corrected AKM, and CRE estimators,
as well as simulation tools. Estimators are tested against simulations to ensure they are correct.
The online documentation is hosted at `https://tlamadon.github.io/pytwoway/ <https://tlamadon.github.io/pytwoway/>`_.

.. :ref:`statsmodels <about:About statsmodels>` is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation
.. of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical
.. data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator.
.. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct. The
.. package is released under the open source Modified BSD (3-clause) license.
.. The online documentation is hosted at `statsmodels.org <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`__.

===========
Quick Start
===========

To install from pip, run::

  pip install pytwoway

To run using command line interface::

  pytw --my-config config.txt --akm --cre

Example config.txt::

    data = file.csv
    filetype = csv
    col_dict = "{'fid': 'your_firmid_col', 'wid': 'your_workerid_col', 'year': 'your_year_col', 'comp': 'your_compensation_col'}"

To run in Python:

- If you have data

.. code-block:: python

    from pytwoway import twfe_network
    tn = twfe_network.twfe_network
    # Create twfe object
    tw_net = tn.twfe_network(data, formatting, col_dict)
    # Convert long data into event study data (not necessary if the data is already in event study format):
    tw_net.refactor_es()
    # Run the bias-corrected AKM estimator:
    tw_net.run_akm_corrected(user_akm)
    # Cluster firms based on their wage CDFs (required for the CRE estimator)
    tw_net.cluster(user_cluster)
    # Run the CRE estimator
    tw_net.run_cre(user_cre)

- If you want to simulate data

.. code-block:: python

    from pytwoway import sim_twfe_network
    sn = sim_twfe_network.sim_twfe_network
    # Create simulated twfe object
    stw_net = sn(sim_params)
    # Generate data
    sim_data = stw_net.sim_network()

- If you want to run Monte Carlo on simulated data

.. code-block:: python

    from pytwoway import sim_twfe_network
    sn = sim_twfe_network.sim_twfe_network
    # Create simulated twfe object
    stw_net = sn(sim_params)
    # Run Monte Carlo
    stw_net.twfe_monte_carlo(N, ncore, akm_params, cre_params, cluster_params)
    # Plot results
    stw_net.plot_monte_carlo()


.. The API focuses on models and the most frequently used statistical test, and tools.
.. :ref:`api-structure:Import Paths and Structure` explains the design of the two API modules and how
.. importing from the API differs from directly importing from the module where the
.. model is defined. See the detailed topic pages in the :ref:`user-guide:User Guide` for a complete
.. list of available models, statistics, and tools.
